# Image-Processing-Analysis
A collect of most important algorithms for image processing and analysis. All the alghoritms are commented in Italian language (because they refers to an Italian University course). In future I will comment the code with English language. 

## Commented with English language: 
1. Ohlander algorithm; 
2. Distance-Transformation algorithm.

### Please note that:
My English skills should be improved, I know, but it is a working progress. Sorry :-)
